        I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, and hands-on experience creating a multitude of full stack web applications. I value being
        challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set. As I continue to learn new languages and
        development techniques I know that I can be an asset to the success of any organization.
