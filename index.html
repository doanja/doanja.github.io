            “People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with
            excellent communication skills. For the past several years I have
            worked in lead qualification, telemarketing, and customer service in
            the technology industry. My experience includes successfully calling
            people in director-level positions of technology departments and
            developing viable leads. I have a track record of maintaining a
            consistent call and activity volume and consistently achieving the
            top 10 percent in sales, and I can do the same thing for your
            company.”

            I am a dedicated person with a family of four. I enjoy reading, and
            the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has
            strengthened my teaching skills and presentation abilities. I have
            been successful at raising a family, and I attribute this success to
            my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at
            once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom, where there
            are many different personalities and learning styles.

            My name is Lucas Martin, and I enjoy meeting new people and finding
            ways to help them have an uplifting experience. I have had a variety
            of customer service opportunities, through which I was able to have
            fewer returned products and increased repeat customers, when
            compared with co-workers. I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team
            player. Who could I speak with in your customer service department
            about your organization’s customer service needs?
